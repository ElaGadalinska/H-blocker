# Welcome to H-blocker
From Lab with Light

Let's make things stronger!

This is where I document my research on improving hydrogen embrittlement resistance in steels using **Laser Shock Peening (LSP)**. I'm part of the **MSCA project H-blocker**, working at **HiLASE, Czech Republic**.

Follow along as I run experiments, analyze microstructures, and try to make metals stronger – with light! ⚡

Use the “Notebook” tab to explore experiment logs and progress updates.
