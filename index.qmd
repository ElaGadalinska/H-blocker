title: "H-blocker – From Lab with Light"
format: html

Welcome to my open lab notebook!

This is where I document my research on improving hydrogen embrittlement resistance in steels using **Laser Shock Peening (LSP)**. I'm part of the **MSCA project H-blocker**, working at **HiLASE, Czech Republic**.

Follow along as I run experiments, analyze microstructures, and try to make metals stronger – with light! ⚡
