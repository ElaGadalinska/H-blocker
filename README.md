# H-blocker: Increasing Hydrogen Embrittlement Resistance Using LSP

**H-blocker** is a research project focused on mitigating hydrogen embrittlement in high-performance steels through the use of **Laser Shock Peening (LSP)**. The project compares materials with different inherent resistance levels to hydrogen degradation to assess the effectiveness of LSP in enhancing structural integrity.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Investigate the effects of LSP on hydrogen embrittlement resistance in different steel grades
- Compare hydrogen charging behavior and fracture characteristics in treated vs. untreated samples
- Disseminate reproducible data and analysis in open-access form
- Share early results through preprints and open science platforms

## 🧪 Materials

- **SS316L**: austenitic stainless steel (baseline hydrogen-resistant material)
- **Ferrium C61 or Maraging 300**: high-strength steels with lower baseline resistance (depending on availability)

## 💡 Experimental Design

- Laser Shock Peening (LSP) applied using high-energy pulsed lasers
- Hydrogen charging under controlled conditions
- Fractography and mechanical testing
- Comparative analysis of microstructure, crack propagation, and failure modes
